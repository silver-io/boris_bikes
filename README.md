#Boris-Bikes

Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and testing with RSpec. The challenge is to simulate the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme in London.

To do so, we've created separate classes for bikes, docking stations, vans, garages, and users.

As a user we should be able to rent a bike from one station and return it to another. A bike can be broken and broken bikes will not be able to leave the docking station. A van will pick them up and take them to a garage for them to get fixed.


## Technologies used

- Rspec

## How to run it
```sh

- Play around with the classes, send bikes around in IRB
